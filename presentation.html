# About me
--

- ## Working in IT operations since 2007.

--

- ## Organizer of DevOps Stockholm since 2011.

--

- ## Currently working at Uprise (an EA owned studio)

--

- ## I like VIM a *bit* to much.

---

# What is Terraform?
--

### _Terraform provides a common configuration to launch infrastructure â€” from physical and virtual servers to email and DNS providers. Once launched, Terraform safely and efficiently changes infrastructure as the configuration is evolved._

### _Simple file based configuration gives you a single view of your entire infrastructure._

# Providers

---

# Providers

* AWS
* Google Cloud Platform
* Digital Ocean
* Terraform
* vSphere
* DNSImple
* Azure
* Cloudflare
* Rundeck
* UltraDNS
* Fastly
* [...] (~50 of them)

---

# Building blocks

---

# Building blocks

## Resources
### A resource is an entity on a provider, for example an EC2 instance.

```
resource aws_instance "demo" {
	ami                    = "${var.demo_ami}"
	instance_type          = "t2.nano"
	subnet_id              = "${aws_subnet.aza.id}"
	vpc_security_group_ids = [ "list", "is", "also", "supported" ]
}```

---

# Building blocks

## Variables

### variables.tf

```
	variable "demo_ami" { default = "" }
```

### terraform.tfvars
```
	demo_ami = "ami-3b9ada48"
```

---

# Building blocks

## Outputs

```
output "demo_instance_id" {
	value = "${aws_instance.demo.id}"
}```

---
# Building Blocks

## Data Sources

```
data "availability_zones" "available" {}
```

```
resource "aws_subnet" "internal" {
	count             = "${length(data.availability_zones.availabable)}"
	availability_zone = "${element(data.availability_zones.available.names, count.index)}"
	[...]
}```

---

# Modules

## A collection of resources exposed as one entity

## For example a VPC module for AWS that configures
* A VPC
* A couple of internal subnets
* A couple of external networks
* Route tables
* Gateways for the external networks
* And some NAT GW:s for those special occasions

---

# Modules
## A collection of resources exposed as one entity
### Might look a bit like this to use
```
module "vpc" {
  source             = "github.com/terraform-community-modules/tf_aws_vpc"

  name               = "my-vpc"

  cidr               = "10.0.0.0/16"
  private_subnets    = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets     = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = "true"

  azs                = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
}```

---

# Good practices

- ## Be liberal with variables.

--

- ## Start small. (You will run `tf destroy`)

--

- ## Make states as small as sensible.

--

- ## Store state remotely.

--

- ## One repo per module.

---

# Good practices

## Repository layout
```
* my_terraform_infra
	* providers
		* aws
			* eu_west_1_staging
				* main.tf (Symlinked to my_terraform_infra/main.tf)
				* staging.tf
				* terraform.tfvars
			* eu_west_1_production
				* main.tf (Symlinked to my_terraform_infra/main.tf)
				* production.tf
				* [...]
	* modules
		* aws
			* my_service
		* datadog
			* my_service_dashboard
* main.tf
```

# Shortcomings

--

- ## No flow control.

--

- ### (Unless you do some element() default value trickery)

--

- ## Looping is limited to resources that supports `count`

--

- ## Error reporting and feedback can be quite confusing

--

- ### (But thats more often the providers API that's not great)

# Collaborating

---

# Collaborating

- ## Store state remote (yes, this is the second time i mention it).

--

- ### For example on S3.

--

- ### Or use terragrunt, it gives you state locking via DynamoDB.

--

- ## Or, you know support Hashicorp and buy an Atlas subscription.
